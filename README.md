# coin-flip-simulator
A simple Python exercise for simulating repeated coin flips. 

For this project, we will learn how to import other parts of Python, use random numbers, build lists, use a for loop, accept user input, and print results to the terminal.

###Objective
This is a project for students who may be using Python for the first time. Through this project, students will learn to use loops, standard libraries, and lists.

###Prerequisites 
In order to complete this project, students must have basic experience with the Vim text editor.

###Desired Outcome
At the completion of this exercise, students should understand:

- Telling a function to run
- Accepting user input to a program
- Importing Python modules
- Use a loop that can run a certain number of times
- Printing text to the console

###Your Challenge
1. Create a `coinflip.py` file.
2. In `coinflip.py`, you need to use functions from the `random` module.
3. Make a function `flip` that takes in a number of times to flip the coin.
4. For each time the coin is flipped, display "Heads" or "Tails" based on the random number chosen.
5. Below this function, ask the user how many times they would like to flip.
6. Call `flip()` with the number the user chose.
7. Once it works, find a way to keep count of how many heads and how many tails were flipped, and have the `flip()` function print this count. Then, test your function with a larger number like 1000.
